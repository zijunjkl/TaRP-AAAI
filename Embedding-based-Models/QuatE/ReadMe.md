This is the folder calculating likelihood scores given embedding-based model QuatE. 

Folder `benchmark`  stores the datasets used for QuatE training

Folder `Embeddings-XXX` stores the learned embeddings on dataset XXX

Pkl file `QuatE_(XXX)_score.pkl` is the pre-computed likelihood score on dataset XXX

To calculate the likelihood score:
Run file: `compute_likelihood_score.py`
