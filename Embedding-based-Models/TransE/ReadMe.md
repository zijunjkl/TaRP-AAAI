This is the folder calculating likelihood scores given embedding-based model RotatE. 

Folder `data`  stores the datasets used for RotatE training

Folder `TransE_XXX` stores the learned embeddings on dataset XXX.

Pkl file `TransE_DBpedia_score.pkl` is the pre-computed likelihood score on dataset DBpedia.

To calculate the likelihood score:
Run file: `TransE_DBpedia_score.py`

For detailed information of TransE, refer to https://github.com/DeepGraphLearning/KnowledgeGraphEmbedding
